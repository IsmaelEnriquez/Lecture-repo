git is a tool used for managing the fukes of repos

Something I learned was that a repo is a collection of files. We can clone it to be able to work on it on our own and then upload it back the repo. 

Another thing I learned was the process of how to write in my repo file, make changes and finally upload it to my repo. 
(1) git status (2) git add (file name) (3) git commit -m <"___"> (4) git push
